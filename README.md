# Studyplanner
This repository is for the studyplanner project from Sebastiaan Jansen.


# Preface
Hey there! My name is Sebastiaan Jansen. I am a 21 year old college student who studies software development at the highschool of Utrecht, the Netherlands. I set up this project as a hobby and for practice, it's something that every real developer should do at some point. But I am also doing this to gain exposure, since the software development sector is big, but competitive. Plus, I feel like I have to show the world that I am passionate in what I do. A project like this is the perfect way to show that!

I am releasing this project under the Unlicense. This is because I don't plan to make money off of this or anything like that, after all it's just a simple studyplanner. But I also want to help students worldwide who are not very good at planning their schoolwork (like myself) for free of charge.
I also want to meet other amateur developers who want to contribute to this project, and possibly spar with them a little. In my opinion, it's important to keep in touch with people of your profession.

That's pretty much all I had to say. I hope you'll have as much fun with this as I had with developing it!


# Current state
This application is currently not in a stable state. Once it is, this will be updated.


# Used techniques
The frontend will be build using JavaFX and SceneBuilder. The backend shall be done with plain Java. The persistency will be done using .obj files, so you don't have to be connected to the internet to run this application.
The project uses Maven for build automation, so dependencies can easily be added and removed.
